- [0-simply_match_school.rb](0-simply_match_school.rb): A Ruby script that uses regular expressions to match the pattern "School" in a given string. It takes an argument from the command line, searches for matches of the word "School", and prints them.
- [1-repetition_token_0.rb](1-repetition_token_0.rb): A Ruby script that uses regular expressions with repetition tokens to match patterns. It matches strings containing "hb" followed by 2 to 5 letter "t"s and ending with "n" (like "hbttn", "hbtttn", etc.).
